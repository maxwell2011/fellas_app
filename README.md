# fellas_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application, just using the fellas as a quick example

Here's the Home page, and all other pages look similar to this.

They are all just skeletons waiting for you to build the DTO's to talk to pocketbase


Here's the Navigation Drawer, and routing is in place. Again, just waiting on your screeens to drop into the prebuilt pages!

Edit the theme document under lib/utils/config/theming.dart to adjust the color schemes
